# TA Management

A team based project where we designed and implemented a site to allow students to sign up for teacher assistant positions. Also allowed for teachers to review applicants
and either accept or reject them.

# Tech
Frontend used html and css, along with the grid system from Bootstrap along with a couple of the buttons. The backend was done in Python, Flask, and SQLalchemy. Initially 
we were using JavaScript but decided to move to only using Flask and Python to send information back and fourth from the server. Passwords are hashed using bcrypt.
